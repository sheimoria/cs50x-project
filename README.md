# Ledg.io
Ledg.io is personal finance tracker on the web.


Inspired by the newfound skills I gained from CS50x's web development track, I wanted to recreate a full stack with CRUD capabilities that would be useful to me as 
a university student.


As I'm getting older, I need to track my income and expenditures, and while I did try expense tracker apps, in my experience the better ones are pay-to-use while the free ones are bloated with ads and useless features, not to mention their terrible UI. Enter Ledg.io, my simple solution to my money problems.


Users can sign up and log into their account, where they can add transactions (both incomes and expenditures) and delete previous ones.


On their dashboard, which is first page users see when they log in, will be tables showing their recent transactions and monthly reports that breakdown where their money is going to.


How does the website break down your expenses?


When users add transactions, they have to put a tag on the transaction indicating what it was for (e.g. salary, transport, food, bills, etc.). This way, the data can be sorted according to tags, which can show users where they spend their money most (and therefore where they should spend less).


Besides that, the website also contains other features such as changing passwords.


All in all, this project was really fun to make, much like the entire course, and I will definitely use my product, along with my newly acquired knowledge in computing, in the future.


Thank you to the entire course team, especially all the lecturers (who are quite simply the BEST). Stay safe everyone. This was CS50!
